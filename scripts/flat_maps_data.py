"""This module handles fetching data for geographical input.

This module contains helper functions that query or fetch data
for geographical input such as a city or street address.

The following helper functions are contained within this module:

    function data_for           - accepts a city name in form of
                                  a string and queries the local
                                  sqlite3 database for the
                                  associated information.

    function get_lat_long       - accepts a street address in form
                                  of a string and requests the
                                  corresponding latitude and longitude
                                  from the locationIQ API.
